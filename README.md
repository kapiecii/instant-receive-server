# instant-receive-server

A simple web application for transferring files over a local network.

## Purpose

This application enables easy file transfer within a local network. It is designed for personal use on trusted networks.

## How to Use

1. Run `webapp.go` to start the application. It will launch on port 8080.
2. Access the application through a web browser.
3. **Important:** This app lacks authentication and security features, as itâ€™s intended for local, trusted networks only.
4. For security, the app will automatically shut down after 3 minutes of inactivity.
5. You can build this application as an executable for various platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) and run it on different environments.

## Build Example

To build for Windows with AMD64 architecture, use the following command:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build webapp.go
```
